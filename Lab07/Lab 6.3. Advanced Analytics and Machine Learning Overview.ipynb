        "# What Is MLlib?\n",
        "MLlib is a package, built on and included in Spark, that provides interfaces for gathering and\n",
        "cleaning data, feature engineering and feature selection, training and tuning large-scale\n",
        "supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, and using those models in production.\n",
        "## When and why should you use MLlib (versus scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or foo package)\n",
        "There are two key use cases where you want to leverage Spark’s ability to scale. First, you want\n",
        "to leverage Spark for preprocessing and feature generation to reduce the amount of time it might\n",
        "take to produce training and test sets from a large amount of data. Then you might leverage\n",
        "single-machine learning libraries to train on those given data sets. Second, when your input data\n",
        "or model size become too difficult or inconvenient to put on one machine, use Spark to do the\n",
        "heavy lifting. Spark makes distributed machine learning very simple.\n",
        "\n",
        "# High-Level MLlib Concepts\n",
        "In MLlib there are several fundamental “structural” types: transformers, estimators, evaluators,\n",
        "and pipelines. By structural, we mean you will think in terms of these types when you define an\n",
        "end-to-end machine learning pipeline. They’ll provide the common language for defining what\n",
        "belongs in what part of the pipeline. Figure 24-2 illustrates the overall workflow that you will\n",
        "follow when developing machine learning models in Spark.\n",
        "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers are functions that convert raw data in some way. This might be to create a new\n",
        "interaction variable (from two other variables), normalize a column, or simply change an\n",
        "Integer into a Double type to be input into a model. An example of a transformer is one that\n",
        "converts string categorical variables into numerical values that can be used in MLlib.\n",
        "Transformers are primarily used in preprocessing and feature engineering. Transformers take a\n",
        "DataFrame as input and produce a new DataFrame as output, as illustrated in Figure 24-3.\n",
        "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Estimators are one of two kinds of things. First, estimators can be a kind of transformer that is\n",
        "initialized with data. For instance, to normalize numerical data we’ll need to initialize our\n",
        "transformation with some information about the current values in the column we would like to\n",
        "normalize. This requires two passes over our data—the initial pass generates the initialization\n",
        "values and the second actually applies the generated function over the data. In the Spark’s\n",
        "nomenclature, algorithms that allow users to train a model from data are also referred to as\n",
        "estimators.\n",
        "\n",
        "An evaluator allows us to see how a given model performs according to criteria we specify like a\n",
        "receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. After we use an evaluator to select the best model\n",
        "from the ones we tested, we can then use that model to make predictions.\n",
        "From a high level we can specify each of the transformations, estimations, and evaluations one\n",
        "by one, but it is often easier to specify our steps as stages in a pipeline. This pipeline is similar to\n",
        "scikit-learn’s pipeline concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Low-level data types\n",
        "In addition to the structural types for building pipelines, there are also several lower-level data\n",
        "types you may need to work with in MLlib (Vector being the most common). Whenever we pass\n",
        "a set of features into a machine learning model, we must do it as a vector that consists of\n",
        "Doubles. This vector can be either sparse (where most of the elements are zero) or dense (where\n",
        "there are many unique values). Vectors are created in different ways. To create a dense vector,\n",
        "we can specify an array of all the values. To create a sparse vector, we can specify the total size\n",
        "and the indices and values of the non-zero elements. Sparse is the best format, as you might have\n",
        "guessed, when the majority of values are zero as this is a more compressed representation. Here\n",
