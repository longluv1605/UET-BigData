    "# Structured Streaming Basics\n",
    "Structured Streaming, as we discussed at the end of Chapter 20, is a stream processing\n",
    "framework built on the Spark SQL engine. Rather than introducing a separate API, Structured\n",
    "Streaming uses the existing structured APIs in Spark (DataFrames, Datasets, and SQL), meaning\n",
    "that all the operations you are familiar with there are supported. Users express a streaming\n",
    "computation in the same way they’d write a batch computation on static data. Upon specifying\n",
    "this, and specifying a streaming destination, the Structured Streaming engine will take care of\n",
    "running your query incrementally and continuously as new data arrives into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Sources\n",
    "Structured Streaming supports several input sources for reading in a streaming fashion. As of\n",
    "Spark 2.2, the supported input sources are as follows:\n",
    "1. Apache Kafka 0.10\n",
    "2. Files on a distributed file system like HDFS or S3 (Spark will continuously read new\n",
    "files in a directory)\n",
    "3. A socket source for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sinks\n",
    "Just as sources allow you to get data into Structured Streaming, sinks specify the destination for\n",
    "the result set of that stream. Sinks and the execution engine are also responsible for reliably\n",
    "tracking the exact progress of data processing. Here are the supported output sinks as of Spark 2.2:\n",
    "1. Apache Kafka 0.10\n",
    "2. Almost any file format\n",
    "3. A foreach sink for running arbitary computation on the output records\n",
    "4. A console sink for testing\n",
    "5. A memory sink for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Modes\n",
    "Defining a sink for our Structured Streaming job is only half of the story. We also need to define\n",
    "how we want Spark to write data to that sink. For instance, do we only want to append new\n",
    "information? Do we want to update rows as we receive more information about them over time\n",
    "(e.g., updating the click count for a given web page)? Do we want to completely overwrite the\n",
    "result set every single time (i.e. always write a file with the complete click counts for all pages)?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we define an output mode, similar to how we define output modes in the static\n",
    "Structured APIs.\n",
    "The supported output modes are as follows:\n",
    "1. Append (only add new records to the output sink)\n",
    "2. Update (update changed records in place)\n",
    "3. Complete (rewrite the full output)\n",
    "\n",
    "One important detail is that certain queries, and certain sinks, only support certain output modes,\n",
    "as we will discuss later in the book. For example, suppose that your job is just performing a map\n",
    "on a stream. The output data will grow indefinitely as new records arrive, so it would not make\n",
    "sense to use Complete mode, which requires writing all the data to a new file at once. In contrast,\n",
    "if you are doing an aggregation into a limited number of keys, Complete and Update modes\n",
    "would make sense, but Append would not, because the values of some keys’ need to be updated\n",
    "over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Triggers\n",
    "Whereas output modes define how data is output, triggers define when data is output—that is,\n",
    "when Structured Streaming should check for new input data and update its result. By default,\n",
    "Structured Streaming will look for new input records as soon as it has finished processing the last\n",
    "group of input data, giving the lowest latency possible for new results. However, this behavior\n",
    "can lead to writing many small output files when the sink is a set of files. Thus, Spark also\n",
    "supports triggers based on processing time (only look for new data at a fixed interval). In the\n",
    "future, other types of triggers may also be supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event-Time Processing\n",
    "Structured Streaming also has support for event-time processing (i.e., processing data based on\n",
    "timestamps included in the record that may arrive out of order). There are two key ideas that you\n",
    "will need to understand here for the moment; we will talk about both of these in much more\n",
    "depth in the next chapter, so don’t worry if you’re not perfectly clear on them at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Watermarks\n",
    "Watermarks are a feature of streaming systems that allow you to specify how late they expect to\n",
    "see data in event time. For example, in an application that processes logs from mobile devices,\n",
    "one might expect logs to be up to 30 minutes late due to upload delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Structured Streaming in Action\n",
    "Let’s get to an applied example of how you might use Structured Streaming. For our examples,\n",
    "we’re going to be working with the Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition Dataset. The\n",
    "data consists of smartphone and smartwatch sensor readings from a variety of devices—\n",
    "specifically, the accelerometer and gyroscope, sampled at the highest possible frequency\n",
    "supported by the devices. Readings from these sensors were recorded while users performed\n",
    "activities like biking, sitting, standing, walking, and so on. There are several different\n",
    "smartphones and smartwatches used, and nine total users."

    "are Parquet, text, JSON, and CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between using the file source/sink and Spark’s static file source is that with\n",
    "streaming, we can control the number of files that we read in during each trigger via the\n",
    "maxFilesPerTrigger option that we saw earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that any files you add into an input directory for a streaming job need to appear in\n",
    "it atomically. Otherwise, Spark will process partially written files before you have finished. On\n",
    "file systems that show partial writes, such as local files or HDFS, this is best done by writing the\n",
    "file in an external directory and moving it into the input directory when finished. On Amazon S3,\n",
    "objects normally only appear once fully written.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kafka source and sink\n",
    "Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-and-subscribe system for streams of data. Kafka lets you\n",

    "stored as streams of records in a fault-tolerant way. Think of Kafka like a distributed buffer.\n",
